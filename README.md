### 🛡 My Security Philosophy: Offensive + Defensive

I focus on the full lifecycle of cybersecurity, from low-level exploit development to infrastructure penetration testing.

* **Red Teaming (Offensive):** Developing custom malware PoCs in **C**, shellcode crafting, and bypassing security mechanisms via syscalls.
* **Blue Teaming (Defensive):** Hardening Linux systems, analyzing traffic patterns with **Tcpdump**, and understanding rootkits to better detect them.
* **Pentesting:** Vulnerability assessment using **Burp Suite** and automated reconnaissance with custom tools.

#### 💻 Low-Level & Systems
* **Languages:** `C` (Syscalls, POSIX), `Python` (Automation)
* **Virtualization:** `QEMU/KVM`, `VMware`, `VirtualBox` (Lab Orchestration)
* **OS:** `Linux` (Advanced CLI, Kernel Internals)

#### 🌐 Network Security & Recon
* **Analysis:** `Wireshark`, `Tcpdump` (Traffic Inspection & Packet Analysis)
* **Scanning:** `Nmap`, `NSLookup`, `Whois`
* **Wireless:** `Aircrack-ng` suite

#### 🛡 Pentest & Exploitation
* **Web:** `Burp Suite` (Proxy & Manual Testing)
* **Bruteforce/Crypto:** `Hashcat`, `Hydra`
* **Debug:** `GDB`
