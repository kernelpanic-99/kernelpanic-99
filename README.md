**Security Researcher & Low-Level Developer**
Exploring the depths of Linux internals, memory management, and network protocols.

### 🛡 My Security Philosophy: Offensive + Defensive

I focus on the full lifecycle of cybersecurity, from low-level exploit development to infrastructure penetration testing.

* **Red Teaming (Offensive):** Developing custom malware PoCs in **C**, shellcode crafting, and bypassing security mechanisms via syscalls.
* **Blue Teaming (Defensive):** Hardening Linux systems, analyzing traffic patterns with **Tcpdump**, and understanding rootkits to better detect them.
* **Pentesting:** Vulnerability assessment using **Burp Suite** and automated reconnaissance with custom tools.
